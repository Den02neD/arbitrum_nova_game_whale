# Arbitrum Nova — Game Whale Tracker

Detects **single transfers ≥ 500 ETH** on Arbitrum Nova — the ultra-low-cost AnyTrust chain built exclusively for gaming and social apps.

Nova has ~100× cheaper fees than Arbitrum One.  
So when someone moves 500+ ETH here —  
they’re not saving money.

They’re **deploying an army**.

## Run

```bash
python arbitrum_nova_game_whale.py
